# registrationSystem
This is a University registration system and it has been my University project
We were doing a module called "web development with php" and I was assigned a task to
Create a system that enables people to fill admission forms and get accepted or rejected.
The form first goes to the finance dep't then to the registry's.

The system also enables student to register semester modules
